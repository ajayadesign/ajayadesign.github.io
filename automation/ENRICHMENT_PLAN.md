## Revenue Model: Full-Service Local Business Intelligence

### The Big Idea

We're not a web design agency. We're a **local business intelligence platform** that:
1. Collects 100+ data points per business (free, public data)
2. Runs them through a scoring model
3. Predicts exactly which services each business needs
4. Sells them that service (or refers to a partner for commission)

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 — Enhanced Website Crawl (Zero API Cost)
> Extend existing page crawl to detect 20+ new signals from HTML we already fetch

1. Contact form detection
2. CTA / booking widget detection (Calendly, Acuity, OpenTable, etc.)
3. POS detection (Square, Toast, Clover scripts)
4. Online ordering detection (DoorDash widget, ChowNow, etc.)
5. Google Analytics / Tag Manager presence
6. Facebook Pixel / retargeting pixels
7. Email marketing signup (Mailchimp, Constant Contact, Klaviyo)
8. CRM detection (HubSpot, Salesforce forms)
9. Live chat widget (Tidio, Drift, Intercom)
10. ADA compliance widget (AccessiBe, UserWay)
11. Cookie consent banner
12. Blog presence + last post date
13. Click-to-call, Maps embed, testimonials
14. Video content on page
15. `ads.txt` detection
16. Payment processors (Stripe, Square, PayPal)
17. Professional photos vs stock (image analysis)
18. Menu / price list available
19. Privacy policy page
20. Careers / hiring page

### Phase 2 — GBP Deep Enrichment (Uses Existing API Key)
> Pull from Places API Detail call (we already make the call, just parse more fields)

1. Business hours completeness
2. Photos count + type breakdown
3. GBP categories (primary + secondary)
4. GBP attributes (accessibility, amenities, etc.)
5. Review text + owner response rate + velocity
6. Popular times / foot traffic patterns
7. Booking/ordering links
8. Service area detection
9. Price level indicator

### Phase 3 — DNS & Email Intelligence (Free Lookups)
> Add to recon phase, pure DNS — no API keys needed

1. MX records → email provider (Google Workspace, M365, none)
2. SPF/DKIM/DMARC presence → email deliverability
3. DNS provider / hosting detection
4. Subdomain enumeration
5. Professional email check (domain email vs `@gmail.com`)

### Phase 4 — Public Records Intelligence (Free Government Data)
> Scrape/API from public government databases

1. Texas SOS business filings (entity type, formation date, status, officers)
2. TDLR license lookups (contractors, cosmetologists, etc.)
3. Health department inspection scores (restaurants — Austin Public Health)
4. Building permit history (City of Austin open data)
5. PPP loan data lookup (SBA public dataset)

### Phase 5 — Social Media Scanner (Free Scraping)
> New enrichment phase — check all major platforms

1. Facebook page detection + follower count + last post
2. Instagram presence + post frequency
3. TikTok presence + engagement
4. YouTube channel + last upload
5. LinkedIn company page
6. Yelp listing + rating + response rate
7. Industry-specific platforms (HomeAdvisor, Zocdoc, WeddingWire, etc.)
8. BBB listing + complaints
9. Nextdoor presence

### Phase 6 — Advertising & Hiring Intelligence (Free Public Data)
> Check public ad libraries and job boards

1. Meta Ad Library lookup (active Facebook/Instagram ads)
2. Google Ads Transparency Center check
3. Indeed/LinkedIn/Google Jobs scrape (open positions, roles, salary)
4. Glassdoor rating + review themes (employee sentiment)

### Phase 7 — Location & Physical Intelligence
> Leverage Google Maps data we already pull

1. Street View storefront analysis (signage quality, condition)
2. Competitor density (same-type businesses within 1 mile)
3. Complementary business detection (cross-sell opportunities)
4. Nearby new construction / development (growth signal)

### Phase 8 — Scoring Overhaul: "Business Health Score"
> Rebuild scoring to incorporate ALL signals into a multi-dimensional score

Dimensions:
- **Digital Presence Score** (0–100): website quality, mobile, SSL, ADA
- **Visibility Score** (0–100): SEO, GBP, social media, directory listings
- **Reputation Score** (0–100): reviews, response rate, sentiment, multi-platform
- **Operations Score** (0–100): booking, ordering, POS, CRM, analytics
- **Growth Score** (0–100): review velocity, hiring, revenue signals, ad spend
- **Compliance Score** (0–100): licenses, ADA, privacy, insurance display
- **Composite Business Health** (0–100): weighted average of all dimensions

Each dimension maps directly to a service offering. Score < 50 in any dimension = automatic service recommendation.

### Phase 9 — Predictive Service Matching
> AI model that matches signals → service recommendations

Input: All enrichment data for a prospect
Output: Ranked list of services they need, with:
- Confidence score (how sure are we they need this?)
- Revenue estimate (what would they pay?)
- Urgency (how soon do they need it?)
- Pitch angle (what's the compelling trigger?)

This becomes the **email template selector** — instead of sending everyone the same "your website needs work" email, we send hyper-targeted pitches based on their specific gaps.

## Technical Notes

- New signals stored in `prospect_enrichment` JSONB column + dedicated columns for key scores
- Pipeline extends: **discover → audit → page-signals → GBP-enrich → DNS-check → public-records → social-scan → ad-intel → recon → score → match-services → enqueue**
- Rate limits: Google Places API (free tier), DNS lookups (unlimited), social scraping (respectful delays), government APIs (generous)
- Estimated total enrichment time per prospect: ~30–60 seconds for all new signals
- No paid APIs required for any phase (all free/public data)
- Data refresh cycle: re-enrich every 30 days to detect changes (new reviews, updated site, new social posts)
