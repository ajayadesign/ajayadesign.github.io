<p>Last thing, then I'll leave you alone (promise).</p>

<p>I recently finished a site for a local business near {{ city }} and their Google Search traffic went up noticeably within the first month. Nothing fancy — just fast loading, proper mobile layout, and the SEO basics done right. It's wild how much of a difference that makes when competitors aren't doing it either.</p>

<p>If you ever want to see what I put together for their site review, or talk through what yours could look like — I'm around. Just reply "interested" and I'll send it over.</p>
