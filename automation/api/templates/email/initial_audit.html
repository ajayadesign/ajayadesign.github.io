<p>Hey there,</p>

<p>Hey {{ owner_first_name }},</p>

<p>I live in Manor and I've been doing free website checkups for local businesses around here — yours caught my eye.</p>

<p>I ran a quick look at <strong>{{ business_name }}</strong>'s site and a couple things stood out:</p>

{% if not speed_good %}
<p style="margin-left: 12px;">→ Your site takes about {{ load_time }} to load. Google starts penalizing anything over 2.5s, so that's likely pushing you down in search results.</p>
{% endif %}
{% if not mobile_good %}
<p style="margin-left: 12px;">→ Mobile score is {{ mobile_score }}/100 — most people searching "{{ business_type }} near me" are on their phone, so that's a big deal.</p>
{% endif %}
{% if not seo_good %}
<p style="margin-left: 12px;">→ Missing some SEO basics ({{ missing_seo }}) — this makes it harder for Google to find and rank you.</p>
{% endif %}
{% if ssl_expired %}
<p style="margin-left: 12px;">→ Your SSL certificate looks expired — Chrome shows "Not Secure" to visitors, which scares people off.</p>
{% endif %}
{% if all_good %}
<p style="margin-left: 12px;">→ Honestly, your site is in better shape than most around here. There's still some room to tighten things up, but you're ahead of the curve.</p>
{% endif %}

<p>Little context on me — I'm a web developer, born in Nepal, and Manor is home now. I'm building my business here doing websites for local shops, restaurants, and service businesses. I don't have 50 clients. I have a handful, and I give each one my full attention.</p>

<p>I put together a full breakdown of your site if you want to see it — no cost, no pitch attached. Just figured you'd want to know where things stand.</p>

<p>Either way, {{ google_rating }} stars across {{ google_reviews }} reviews — clearly doing something right. 🙌</p>
