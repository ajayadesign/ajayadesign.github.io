<p>Found <strong>{{ business_name }}</strong> on Google Maps — {{ google_rating }} stars across {{ google_reviews }} reviews. That's genuinely impressive. Your customers clearly love what you do.</p>

<p>I noticed you don't have a website listed though. I know a lot of businesses do fine without one, but here's the thing — when someone searches "{{ business_type }} near me" on Google (and {{ industry_mobile_pct }}% of those searches are on mobile), only businesses with websites show up in Google Search results. Without one, you're only showing up on Maps, and a lot of people scroll right past that.</p>

<p>I'm Ajaya — I live here in Manor and I build websites for local businesses in the area. I'm not a big agency, just a one-person shop trying to help businesses around here get found online. I moved here from Nepal a while back and this community has been home since.</p>

<p>If you've ever thought about getting a site up, I'd be happy to chat about what that would look like for {{ business_name }}. No pressure at all — I know it's not for everyone. But with your reviews, a simple site that shows up on Google could bring in a lot of people who are currently finding your competitors instead.</p>

<p>Just reply if you're curious. Or feel free to ignore this — no hard feelings either way.</p>

<p>– Ajaya</p>
