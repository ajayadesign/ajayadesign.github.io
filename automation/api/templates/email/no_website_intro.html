<p>I found {{ business_name }} on Google Maps — {{ google_rating }} stars across {{ google_reviews }} reviews tells me you're doing something right. That's a hard thing to earn.</p>
{% else %}
<p>I found {{ business_name }} on Google Maps — it's clear from your listing that you've built something solid. That's a hard thing to do.</p>
{% endif %}

<p>One thing I noticed is you don't seem to have a website yet. Right now, someone searching "{{ business_type }} in {{ city }}" on Google will mostly see competitors like {{ competitor_name }} who do have one — even if you have better reviews.</p>

<p>A simple, well-built website would let Google show you in search results (not just Maps), give people a place to see your hours, services, and all those great reviews — and honestly, for a business with your reputation, it could make a real difference.</p>

<p>Little context on me — I'm a web developer, born in Nepal, and Manor is home now. I'm building my business here doing websites for local shops, restaurants, and service businesses. I don't have 50 clients. I have a handful, and I give each one my full attention.</p>

<p>If you're ever curious what a site could look like for {{ business_name }}, I'm happy to sketch something out. No cost, and absolutely no pressure.</p>
