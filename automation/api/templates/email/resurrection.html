{% if owner_first_name == 'there' %}
<p>Hey there,</p>
{% else %}
<p>Hey {{ owner_first_name }},</p>
{% endif %}

<p>I reached out {{ months_later }} ago about <strong>{{ business_name }}</strong>'s website. At the time the timing wasn't right, and that's totally fine.</p>

<p>I've picked up a few more local clients since then and learned a ton about what actually moves the needle for {{ business_type }}s in the {{ city }} area. Figured I'd check in and see if anything has changed on your end.</p>

{% if has_audit %}
<p>Your site was scoring around {{ speed_score }}/100 when I last looked at it. Happy to run a fresh check if you're curious how things stand now — takes me about 10 minutes and it's on the house.</p>
{% else %}
<p>If you've been thinking about getting a website up (or updating what you've got), I'd love to chat. No pressure — just a quick conversation to see if it even makes sense.</p>
{% endif %}

<p>Either way, hope business is going well.</p>
