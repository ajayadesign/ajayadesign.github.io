<p>Hey — </p>

<p>Just bumping this up in case it got buried. I know how crazy running a {{ business_type }} gets.</p>

{% if has_audit and not mobile_good %}
<p>One thing I keep thinking about with your site — {{ industry_mobile_pct }}% of people searching for a {{ business_type }} near {{ city }} are on their phone. With a mobile score of {{ mobile_score }}/100, a lot of those people are probably bouncing before they even see what you offer. That's low-hanging fruit.</p>
{% elif has_audit and not speed_good %}
<p>The main thing that stood out when I looked at your site was the load time ({{ load_time }}). Google's pretty aggressive about pushing slow sites down in rankings now. Quick fix with big payoff.</p>
{% else %}
<p>I still have that site review sitting here if you want a look. No expiration date on it — just let me know.</p>
{% endif %}

<p>Happy to chat whenever. Even if it's just a 5-minute call to go over what I found.</p>
