<p>I was looking into {{ business_name }} and noticed something you might want to know — your website at {{ website_url }} doesn't seem to be loading. When I try to visit it, I get an error page.</p>

{% if has_google_presence %}
<p>The tricky part is that your Google Maps listing still links to it, so anyone who clicks through from Google sees that error instead of your business. Meanwhile, your {{ google_rating }}-star rating across {{ google_reviews }} reviews shows you're clearly doing great work — it's just that your website isn't reflecting that right now.</p>

<p>Little context on me — I'm a web developer, born in Nepal, and Manor is home now. I'm building my business here doing websites for local shops, restaurants, and service businesses. I don't have 50 clients. I have a handful, and I give each one my full attention.</p>

<p>If you'd like, I could take a look and let you know whether it's a quick fix or if a fresh start might make more sense. Either way, happy to help — no charge for the advice.</p>
